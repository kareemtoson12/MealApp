Meal App using Flutter
My MealApp provides recipe and other useful information for some of the popular delicious dishes. You can filter out different recipes according to your requirement and even mark them as favorite in case you find something interesting.

Flutter Concepts:
State management using Provider.
Storing persistent data (like favorite meals) locally in the device using SharedPreferences.
Navigating through multiple screens and argument passing.
Flutter widgets (stateless and stateful) and styling.
